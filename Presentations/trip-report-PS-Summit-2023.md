## Summit Sessions and Participation

- [**No Computer Necessary: Managing Azure with Azure Cloud Shell**](https://pshsummit2023.sessionize.com/session/406028)-This session was a 45-minute presentation on how to use Azure Cloud Shell to manage Azure resources. It covered the basics of Azure Cloud Shell, how to use it, and how to customize it. It also covered how to use it to manage Azure resources using PowerShell, Azure CLI, and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. The session was recorded and will be available on the summit website. Approximately 50-60 attendees.
- **Sky's the Limit...Level Up Your Career to the Cloud** - This session was for the On-Ramp track and was a 90 minute session. It covered the basics of cloud computing, how to get started with Azure, and then a AMA with the attendees. It was a great opportunity to help new users get started with Azure and cloud computing. I really enjoyed the great questions including many questions on how we create docs & one attendee asked how they could become a content developer. 13 On-Ramp attendees.
- [**PowerShell & Your Next Career Steps: Oh, the Places You'll Go!**](https://pshsummit2023.sessionize.com/session/405493). This was a 45-minute panel discussion with 2 other presenters. We discussed our career journeys, tips for being sucessful, and the importance of networking. It was a great opportunity to share my career journey and help others. 50-60 attendees.
- Recorded a "live" edition of [Wired for Hybrid](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/wired-for-hybrid-what-s-new-in-azure-networking-april-2023/ba-p/3810931) with Pierre Roman of the Cloud Advocacy Team. This was a true highlight. Doing a talking-head video that isn't on Teams brought the conversation and energy to a new level. I defintely look forward to other opportunities to work with Pierre & others in person. Maybe next time we'd do some work in the studio.
- **PowerShell Doc-A-Thon w/ Sean Wheeler and Mike Robbins**. This was an awesome event. We had 20+ attendees and worked on a number of issues in the PowerShell docs repo. It was great to work with the attendees and help them get started with contributing to the docs. In the end, 19 people submitted 62 PRs affecting 204 files in the PowerShell library.
- **All networking events and activities**. This is where I got to meet a number of new people and catch up with old friends. It was great to meet new people and hear their stories. I also had the opportunity to meet with a number of PowerShell team members and other Microsoft employees. Another thing that is hard to do remotely.

While in town, I had the opportunity to work in building 83, have lunch with my teammates in town, and meet with various FTEs in town. It was awesome to be able to meet my team in person. I'm definitely looking forward to next year's summit and other opportunities to visit campus.

## Takeaways

- The PowerShell community is awesome! While I knew a number of people in attendance, this years summit had 70% new attendees. It was great to meet new people and hear their stories. Also, many of the attendees who had attended before had come back as presenters. The community and conference does a great job of encouraging people to get involved and share their knowledge.
- Everything changes when you meet in person. This goes for summit and work. When I first joined Microsoft in 2018, I was remote. I had the opportunity to visit campus multiple times and it was a game changer. I've always found meeting in-person enhances the relationship and makes it easier to work together.
- Seeing how Mike and Sean ran the doc-a-thon, I'm looking forward to trying out the concept in the Azure Networking library. It was a great way to get people involved and contributing to the docs.
