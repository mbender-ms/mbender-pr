   1. Materials should be dry and free from moisture to ensure optimal shredding performance.
   2. **Do not shred full-scale 3D printed objects**. Cut them into smaller pieces before loading them into the hopper.
   3. To improve shredding efficiency, reduce the size of the materials by cutting them into smaller pieces.
   4. Avoid overloading the hopper to prevent jamming and ensure smooth operation.
   5. Always wear protective gloves and eye protection when handling materials.
