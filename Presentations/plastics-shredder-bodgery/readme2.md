## Shredder Overview

The **Plastics Shredder** is designed for recycling 3D printed plastics PLA and home recyclable softs plastics like HDPE. The shredder is capable of reducing plastic waste into small, uniform shreds that can be used for various applications, such as 3D printing filament production, recycling, and more. The shredder features a powerful motor, stainless steel blades, and a sturdy aluminum frame for efficient and reliable operation. By shredding plastic waste, you can reduce the volume of materials, create new products, and contribute to a more sustainable future.

**NOTE: Use of the plastics shredder is a privilege, not a right. Failure to follow the guidelines may result in loss of access to the shredder.**

**Safety Precautions: Always wear safety glasses and gloves when operating the shredder. Keep long hair and loose clothing away from the hopper and cutting chamber. and never place foreign objects, such as metal or glass, into the shredder.

   1. One suggestion is to take all plastics, place in a cloth bag and wash in a dishwasher or washing machine. Then dry on low/no heat in dryer or layout to dry on a towel.
2. Before using the shredder on your plastic waste, please ensure it is clean, dry, and sized for the shredder.
3. **DO NOT** shred plastic with any form of a label attached.
4. All 3D prints need to be broken into smaller pieces. The shredder will not shred large, whole prints.

### Shredder Prep

1. Find a safe location within the plastics area to operate the shredder. It needs to be close to a power outlet.
2. Ensure the shredder is on a stable surface and the power cord is not tangled or obstructed.
3. Check the hopper and cutting chamber for any debris or obstructions. Clear any foreign objects before operating the shredder.
4. Ensure the collection bin is in place and ready to receive the shredded materials.
5. Plug in the shredder and leave power switch on the power supplies in the "OFF" position.

### Load Materials

    1. Ensure that the materials are clean, dry and free from foreign objects. **Never place items in the shredder while it is running**.
    2. **Do not shred full-scale 3D printed objects**. Cut them into smaller pieces before loading them into the hopper.
3. To improve shredding efficiency, reduce the size of the materials by cutting them into smaller pieces.
4. Avoid overloading the hopper to prevent jamming and ensure smooth operation.
5. Always wear protective gloves and eye protection when handling materials.
6. Never place foreign objects, such as metal or glass, into the shredder.
7. Keep long hair and loose clothing away from the hopper and cutting chamber.

2. Turn on the power supply.
3. On the controller, move the black control switch to the left (counter-clockwise). The machine will begin shredding the materials.
4. When the shredding is complete, move the control switch to the right (clockwise) to stop the machine.
5. Check consistency of shreds in bin. If the shreds are too large, run the material through the shredder again.

### Clean Up

1. After you have completing shredding, run the shredder in reverse and forward for a few seconds to clear any remaining materials.
2. Turn off the power and unplug the machine.
3. Empty the collection bin of all shredded materials. Wipe out any remaining debris with a clean, dry cloth.
