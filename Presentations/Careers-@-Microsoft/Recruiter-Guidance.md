# Guidance from a Microsoft recruiter

## Important topics to prepare for your interview

1. **Clarifying Questions:** Listen to the question and define the parameters, boundaries, or root of problem before trying to solve or answer it. If you get stuck, ask more clarifying questions to help unblock you.
   - Diagram the problem to help define the parameters and ask questions about it.
   - Listen to what you are being asked and validate your assumptions.
  
2. Explain your thought process (aloud in an interview situation) about possible approaches, their pros and cons, examples from your previous experiences.
   - Add context to your answers and provide actual examples that were "impactful and meaningful”.
   - How you owned a role and moved the needle forward, demonstrated curiosity, and how you solved it.
  
3. Demonstrate a Growth Mindset and passion. Why Microsoft? Why this team?
   - Think Customer obsession, ownership, curiosity, and thinking big.
   - Think through examples about past outcomes, milestones, deliverables, and how you interacted and collaborated with others.
