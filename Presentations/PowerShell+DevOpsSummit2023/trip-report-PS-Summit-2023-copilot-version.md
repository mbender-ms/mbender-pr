Hey there!

I just got back from the PowerShell Summit 2023 in Bellevue, WA and wanted to share my experience with you. It was an amazing event that brought together PowerShell enthusiasts and team members from around the world. Here are some highlights:

- 250 attendees and presenters from around the world, including PowerShell team members, MVPs, Microsoft employees, and IT professionals.
- 50+ sessions and 35+ lightning demos on PowerShell, DSC, DevOps, and related technologies.
- A vendor expo and a hack-a-docs event hosted by members of the PowerShell docs team.
- A parallel track of sessions for PowerShell beginners called On-Ramp, which covered topics like Kubernetes, Docker, and Azure.

I participated in several sessions, including:

- "No Computer Necessary: Managing Azure with Azure Cloud Shell" - a 45-minute presentation on how to use Azure Cloud Shell to manage Azure resources.
- "Sky's the Limit...Level Up Your Career to the Cloud" - a 90-minute session for the On-Ramp track that covered the basics of cloud computing and how to get started with Azure.
- "PowerShell & Your Next Career Steps: Oh, the Places You'll Go!" - a 45-minute panel discussion on career journeys, tips for success, and the importance of networking.
- A "live" edition of Wired for Hybrid with Pierre Roman of the Cloud Advocacy Team.
- PowerShell Doc-A-Thon with Sean Wheeler and Mike Robbins, where we worked on a number of issues in the PowerShell docs repo.
- All networking events and activities, where I got to meet a number of new people and catch up with old friends.

While in town, I also had the opportunity to work in building 83, have lunch with my teammates, and meet with various FTEs. It was awesome to be able to meet my team in person.

Some takeaways from the event:

- The PowerShell community is awesome! It was great to meet new people and hear their stories.
- Everything changes when you meet in person. It was a game changer to be able to meet my team and other colleagues in person.
- Seeing how Mike and Sean ran the doc-a-thon, I'm looking forward to trying out the concept in the Azure Networking library.
- I talked with a number of people about Docs and what they like and don't like. Freshness, accessibility, and accuracy were the top three things that came up. Videos and interactive content were also mentioned.
- It was great to hear what people are doing with AI, ChatGPT, and the future of work. I'm definitely planning on talks around this topic in the future.

Overall, it was an amazing experience and I'm already looking forward to next year's summit. If you're interested in learning more about the sessions, check out pshsummit2023.sessionize.com.
