# Visualize Your Work with Planner and To-Do 

## Abstract
During this session you will learn how to use Planner and To-Do to visualize your work, and more effectively deal with your workload. You'll learn about Personal Kanban as a methodology for visualizing work and prioritizing what matters. Then, you'll see how to use this method in action with Planner, and you'll walk through some basics for using To-Do. There will be plenty of time for Q&A.
